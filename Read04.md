## JavaScript

 *(JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative.*

 *JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with proven tools for building scalable, interactive web applications.*

 **The Input from JS**
 - **Prompt** : The fist one is called prompt. It will show a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in.
 - **Confrim**: The other pop-up is not really an input method. It allows the developer to ask a Yes/No question
