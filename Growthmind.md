*Talking about very important definitions which effect our protocol of thinking and our life significantly,Growth mindest and fixed mindset.*  

## A Growth mindset
 It is a believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort or in other defnetion it means that you thrive on challenge, and don’t see failure as a way to describe yourself but as a springboard for growth and developing your abilities.
 
 ## A Fixed mindset
 That intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits cannot change.  people which follow it  document their intelligence and talents rather than working to develop and improve them. suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone.

 #### There are many factors associated with influencing this concept, including:
 - Challenges
 - Obstacles
 - Effort
 - Criticism
 - Success of others  

By talking about the **challenges** , The GM encourages you to face it and look for other problems to solve it ,As for the **obstacles**, their meaning is a little different than the challenges. They are more severe, and when you are in the midst of solving the problem, you will see what is impossible to overcome. In this case, you have to give yourself a lot of time and patience,Therefore, making a great **effort** in trying to maintain the stability of psychological energy is necessary,In the end, you will come to a solution.
And in the end, two things are important for progress and continuity. **Criticism**, for example, is a mirror of our mistakes and progress, as well as looking at **people's success** stories and accompanying them to learn from them, which has a great positive impact on our successful progress.
 
Fixed Mind | Growth Mind 
----------- | ----------
Avoid challenges     | Embrace challenges 
Give up easily due to obstracels | Persist despite obstracels 
Ignore useful feedback| learn from criticism 
See effort as fruitless| see effort as path to mastery 

*Finally, I want to mention some tips for staying in a growth mindset*
1. Acknowledge and embrace imperfections.
Hiding from your weaknesses means you’ll never overcome them.

2. View challenges as opportunities.
Having a growth mindset means relishing opportunities for self-improvement. Learn more about how to fail well.

3. Try different learning tactics.
There’s no one-size-fits-all model for learning. What works for one person may not work for you. Learn about learning strategies.
