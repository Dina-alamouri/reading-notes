# JavaScript


 *(JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.*

 **JavaScript data types and data structures**

 - Dynamic typing:  
JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type
- Data and Structure types:
  Six Data Types that are primitives, checked by typeof operator:
undefined ,Boolean, Number, String, BigInt Symbol.

**The Input of JS**
- prompt
 It will show a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in.

 - confirm
The other pop-up is not really an input method. It allows the developer to ask a Yes/No question. Calling the confirm() function will show a pop-up window with the provided texts and with two buttons.
