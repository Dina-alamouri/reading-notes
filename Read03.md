 # What Wireframing?
**Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.**

*When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code. Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.*

# HTML 
**HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. **

- **The opening tag**: This consists of the name of the element 
- **The closing tag**: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name.  
- **The content**: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
- **The element**: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
