# Operators
JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional operator

** Assignment operators** 
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

**Comparison operators**
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

**Arithmetic operators**
An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

**Logical operators**
Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value.

**String operators**
In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.



# loops
*There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)
The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.*

- **for statement.**

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

- **while statement**
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

- **break statement**
Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.
